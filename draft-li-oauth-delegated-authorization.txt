                   OAuth 2.0 Delegated Authorization
             draft-li-oauth-delegated-authorization-latest

Abstract

   Delegated authorization enables a client to delegate a subset of its
   granted privileges to a subordinate access token (also known as a
   delegated access token).  This mechanism allows the client to
   securely delegate authorization to a delegated party while
   maintaining fine-grained control over delegated permissions.

1.  Introduction

   OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] provides a framework for authorizing third-party
   applications to access protected resources on behalf of a resource
   owner.  However, in existing implementations, access tokens issued to
   clients often contain excessive permissions that exceed actual
   requirements, creating security vulnerabilities and potential data
   exposure risks.

   This specification extends OAuth 2.0 with a delegated authorization
   framework that enables clients to create subordinate access tokens
   with restricted permissions.  This approach addresses the problem of
   over-privileged access tokens by implementing a two-token
   architecture that decouples initial authorization from final resource
   access.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   This specification uses the following terms defined in OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749]: authorization server, client, resource server, and
   resource owner.

   The following additional terms are used throughout this document:

   *Delegated Party (DP)*:  An entity (e.g., a service, component, or
      application) authorized by the client to access protected
      resources on behalf of the resource owner.

   *Delegated Resource*:  A resource or API endpoint hosted by the
      delegated party that requires access to the resource owner’s
      protected data at a target resource server.

   *Delegation Token*:  A token issued by the authorization server for
      the client that enables the client to create delegated access
      tokens.

   *Delegated Access Token*:  A token created by the client using the
      delegation token, with permissions being a subset of the
      delegation token's privileges and a more limited lifespan.

   *Delegation Key*:  A cryptographic key bound to the delegation token,
      used by the client to sign or encrypt delegated access tokens.
      The delegation key is presented in the token request as the
      delegation_key parameter.

4.  Overview

   The delegated authorization framework introduces a hierarchical token
   structure where a client can obtain a delegation token from an
   authorization server and use it to issue subordinate access tokens
   with reduced permissions.  This enables fine-grained access control
   while maintaining the security properties of the original
   authorization grant.

          Figure 1: Delegated Authorization Framework Architecture

   1.  The client requests authorization from the resource owner.  The
       client indicates in the authorization request that the requested
       authorization grant is for delegated authorization.

   2.  The client receives an authorization grant.

   3.  The client requests a delegation token by authenticating with the
       authorization server and presenting the authorization grant and
       its delegation key as defined in Section 3.

   4.  The authorization server authenticates the client and validates
       the authorization grant, and if valid, issues a delegation token.

   5.  The client calls the delegated party's API, presenting the
       delegated access token generated from the delegation token.  The
       delegated access token is issued by the client using the
       delegation key.  The delegated party requests the target
       protected resource from the resource server and presents the
       delegated access token.

   6.  The resource server validates the delegated access token, and if
       valid, serves the resource.  The delegated party receives the
       resource, optionally transforms it into a service-specific
       response (also known as delegated resource), and returns it to
       the client.

   Both delegation token and delegated access token can be JSON Web
   Tokens (JWTs) [RFC7519] or CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs) [RFC8392].

5.  Delegated Party Metadata

   Before the OAuth 2.0 client retrieves a delegation token and
   generates a delegated access token for the delegated party, the
   client needs to obtain the authorization server endpoint and the
   permissions needed by the delegated party.  Such information can be
   manually configured into the client, or it can be dynamically
   discovered through delegated party metadata.

   Delegated party metadata enables OAuth 2.0 clients to obtain
   information needed to interact with a delegated party.  The structure
   of the metadata format is similar to "OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server
   Metadata" [RFC8414] and "OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata"
   [RFC9728].

   The delegated party metadata is retrieved from a well-known [RFC8615]
   location as a JSON [RFC8259] document.  By default, the well-known
   URI string used is /.well-known/oauth-delegated-party.

5.1.  Delegated Party Metadata Attributes

   *resources*:  *RECOMMENDED*. JSON array containing a list of target
      protected resources' resource identifiers, as defined in
      [RFC9728].  Either this attribute or *authorization_servers*
      defined below MUST be present.

   *authorization_servers*:  *OPTIONAL*. JSON array containing a list of
      OAuth authorization server issuer identifiers, as defined in
      [RFC8414].  Either this attribute or *resources* defined above
      MUST be present.

   *permissions_supported*:  *RECOMMENDED*. JSON object indicating the
      permissions the delegated party may request.  The scopes attribute
      lists supported scope values [RFC6749]; the authorization_details
      attribute lists supported rich authorization request objects as
      defined in [RFC9396].  These guide the client in constructing
      valid authorization and token requests.  Either the scopes
      attribute or the authorization_details attribute must be present.

   *api_permissions*:  *RECOMMENDED*. JSON object mapping API endpoints
      (resource identifiers) to the permissions required to access them.
      Each value can include scopes and/or authorization_details to
      specify the permissions needed for that endpoint/resource.

   *delegated_party_documentation*:  *OPTIONAL*: URL of a page
      containing human-readable information that developers might want
      or need to know when using the delegated party.  The value of this
      field MAY be internationalized.

5.2.  Delegated Party Metadata Example

   The following is a non-normative example delegated party metadata:

   {
     "resources": [
       "https://res1.example.com",
       "https://res2.example.net"
     ],
     "authorization_servers": [
       "https://as1.example.com",
       "https://as2.example.net"
     ],
     "permissions_supported": {
       "scopes": ["profile:read", "profile:write", "email:read", "email:write"],
       "authorization_details": [
         {
           "type": "payment",
           "actions": ["initiate", "status", "cancel"],
           "instructedAmount": {
             "notMoreThan": {
               "currency": "USD",
               "amount": "500.00"
             }
           }
         }
       ]
     },
     "api_permissions": {
       "/emails/list": {
         "scopes": ["email:read"]
       },
       "/balance/transfer": {
         "authorization_details": [
           {
             "type": "payment",
             "actions": ["initiate"],
             "instructedAmount": {
               "notMoreThan": {
                 "currency": "USD",
                 "amount": "500.00"
               }
             }
           }
         ]
       },
       "/balance/transfer/status": {
         "authorization_details": [
           {
             "type": "payment",
             "actions": ["status"]
           }
         ]
       },
       "/balance/transfer/cancel": {
         "authorization_details": [
           {
             "type": "payment",
             "actions": ["cancel"]
           }
         ]
       }
     },
     "delegated_party_documentation": "https://dp.example.com/dp_documentation.html"
   }

5.3.  WWW-Authenticate

   Upon receipt of a request for a delegated resource that lacks
   credentials, the delegated party can reply with a challenge using the
   401 (Unauthorized) status code ([RFC9110] Section 15.5.2) and the
   WWW-Authenticate header field ([RFC9110] Section 11.6.1).

   This specification introduces a new parameter in the WWW-Authenticate
   HTTP response header field to indicate the delegated party metadata
   URL:

   *delegated_party_metadata*:  The URL of the delegated party metadata.

   The response below is an example of a WWW-Authenticate header that
   includes the delegated party metadata URL.  NOTE: '\' line wrapping
   per [RFC8792].

   HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
   WWW-Authenticate: Bearer delegated_party_metadata=\
     "https://dp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-delegated-party"

6.  Acquiring Delegation Tokens

   The client requests a delegation token using standard OAuth 2.0 grant
   types with additional parameters to distinguish delegation requests
   from standard token requests.

6.1.  Authorization Code Grant

   For authorization code grant type, the client MUST include a
   delegation=true parameter in the authorization request to indicate
   that the client is requesting a delegation token instead of an OAuth
   2.0 access token.

   Additionally, the authorization request MUST include either a scope
   parameter (as defined in [RFC6749] Section 3.3), an
   authorization_details parameter (as defined in "Rich Authorization
   Requests" [RFC9396]), or both, that define the permissions granted to
   the requested delegation token.

   In the token request, the client MUST include a delegation_key
   parameter with the value of the delegation key.  This is normally a
   public key for digital signature.  It can be extended to support
   encryption public keys, or secret keys for MAC or symmetric
   encryption.

   Additionally, the client MAY include in the token request either a
   scope parameter, an authorization_details parameter, or both.  The
   client MAY also include a delegation=true parameter in the token
   request.

   In the token response, the authorization server MUST include an
   access_token attribute whose value is the delegation token, and MUST
   include a token_type attribute valued "Delegation", and MAY include a
   refresh_token attribute which is the refresh token for obtaining a
   new delegation token via the refresh token grant.

   Other procedures of the authorization code grant are as described in
   [RFC6749].  Use of Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) [RFC7636] is
   RECOMMENDED.

6.2.  Other Grant Types

   Other OAuth 2.0 grant types, such as the refresh token grant or
   client credentials grant, MAY support delegated authorization by
   including the delegation and delegation_key parameters when
   applicable.  The authorization server MUST validate that the client
   is authorized to request delegation tokens using the given grant
   type.

7.  Creating Delegated Access Tokens

   The client creates delegated access tokens by:

   1.  Validating the delegation token's validity and permissions.

   2.  Generating a subordinate access token with (optionally) reduced
       privileges.

   3.  Applying cryptographic protection using the delegation key
       (digital signature, encryption or MAC).

   The client MUST include the delegation token in the delegation_token
   attribute of the delegated access token.

   The client MUST ensure that the delegated access token's scope,
   lifetime, audience, and other claims do not exceed those of the
   delegation token.  The client MAY generate single-use delegated
   access tokens that the resource server or authorization server only
   consider valid when validating it for the first time.

   The client is RECOMMENDED to "sender-constrain" the delegated access
   tokens by binding the delegated access tokens with public keys or
   certificates where the corresponding private keys are owned by the
   delegated parties, via techniques similar to OAuth 2.0 mTLS [RFC8705]
   or OAuth 2.0 DPoP [RFC9449].

8.  Using Delegated Access Tokens

   When the client accesses a delegated resource on the delegated party,
   the client MUST include the delegated access token as a bearer token
   [RFC6750] in the Delegated-Authorization header, used by the target
   resource server to verify requests from the delegated party.  The
   Delegated-Authorization header MAY be used in combination with an
   Authorization header used by the delegated party to verify the
   request from the client.

   For example:

   GET /dp-resource HTTP/1.1
   Host: delegated-party.example.com
   Authorization: Bearer mF_9.B5g1234
   Delegated-Authorization: Bearer mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM

   Upon receiving a delegated resource request with a Delegated-
   Authorization header, the delegated party sends a request to the
   target resource server for the respective target resource.  The
   delegated party MUST include the received delegated access token as a
   bearer token in the Authorization header.

   For example:

   GET /target-resource HTTP/1.1
   Host: resource.example.com
   Authorization: Bearer mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM

9.  Verification of Delegated Access Tokens

   Resource servers verify delegated access tokens through either local
   validation using pre-configured public keys or remote validation via
   token introspection [RFC7662] at the authorization server.

9.1.  Local Verification

   The resource server verifies delegated access tokens by:

   1.  The resource server is pre-configured with the authorization
       server's public key, or it fetches the public key via the
       authorization server's JWKS endpoint [RFC7517].

   2.  Checking the digital signature of the delegation token (part of
       the delegated access token) against the authorization server's
       public key.

   3.  Checking the digital signature of the delegated access token
       against the delegation key bound to the delegation token.

   4.  Verifying the delegated access token's permissions and validity
       are within the scope of the delegation token.

   5.  Verifying the delegated access token is within validity period,
       and the delegated access token's permissions cover the resource
       request.

9.2.  Token Introspection

   The resource server sends the delegated access token to the
   authorization server via the token introspection endpoint.  The
   authorization server verifies the delegated access token against its
   keys.

10.  Security Considerations

   This specification extends OAuth 2.0 to support delegated
   authorization through hierarchical token issuance.  While this
   enables fine-grained privilege delegation, it also introduces new
   trust and security considerations.

   *  Delegation tokens MUST NOT be sent to resource servers without
      subordinate delegated access tokens.  Resource servers and
      authorization servers MUST NOT treat delegation tokens as regular
      OAuth access tokens.

   *  Clients MUST protect the delegation key, as compromise allows an
      attacker to mint valid delegated access tokens within the scope of
      the delegation token.

   *  Delegated access tokens SHOULD have short lifetimes and be bound
      to specific audiences, methods, and sender keys (e.g., via DPoP or
      mTLS) to mitigate replay and token leakage risks.  Resource
      servers MUST validate both the delegation token and the delegated
      access token, ensuring the latter does not exceed the former’s
      permissions.

   *  Token introspection CAN be used in scenarios where the tokens are
      kept opaque from the delegated party and the resource server.  If
      employed, token introspection responses MUST NOT reveal sensitive
      internal information.  Authorization servers SHOULD enforce rate
      limiting and audit token issuance and validation activities.

11.  Operational Considerations

   Deployments of this specification should consider the following
   operational aspects:

   *  *Key Management*: Clients MUST securely store and rotate
      delegation keys.  Authorization servers SHOULD support key
      rotation for delegation tokens and provide mechanisms to revoke
      compromised keys.

   *  *Token Lifetimes*: Delegation tokens SHOULD have longer lifetimes
      than delegated access tokens to reduce authorization server load,
      and SHOULD be refreshable using refresh tokens.

   *  *Metadata Caching*: Delegated party metadata at the well-known URI
      /.well-known/oauth-delegated-party can be cached by clients; a
      reasonable default TTL (e.g., 24 hours) is RECOMMENDED.

   *  *Error Handling*: Delegated parties and resource servers SHOULD
      provide clear error responses (e.g., invalid token, insufficient
      scope) without exposing implementation details.

   *  *Interoperability*: Implementers SHOULD ensure compatibility with
      existing OAuth 2.0 features such as PKCE, Rich Authorization
      Requests, and sender-constrained tokens.

Appendix A.  Token Format

   The example tokens in this section are shown in Flattened JSON
   Serialization [RFC7515] [RFC7516], un-base64url-encoded/unencrypted,
   and with comments for ease of reading.  When used as JWTs [RFC7519],
   they should be represented in Compact Serialization [RFC7515]
   [RFC7516].  Similarly, they can be represented as CWTs [RFC8392].

A.1.  Example 1

   In this example, the delegation token is a JWS token signed with
   HS256, and the delegated access token is a JWS token signed with
   RS256.

Appendix B.  Use Cases

B.1.  Delegating Subset of Access Rights to Specialized AI Agents

   Enterprise Identity and Access Management systems often employ Role
   Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC),
   assigning a set of minimal permissions to the employee based on its
   role, department, or other attributes.  AI Agent can be an employee's
   personal assistant, or a virtual employee of a certain department in
   general.  An Agent's delegated permissions CAN be long-termed, but
   MUST NOT be a direct inheritance of all its owner's access right.
   Rather, they SHOULD be a subset of its owner, bound to specfic
   service/API/database/codebase according to its specialty and
   dedicated workflow.

     +==================+===========================================+
     | Role             | Service / Component                       |

B.2.  Third-Party Analytics Platform Integrated in an Enterprise SaaS

   In this scenario, a corporate customer uses a Software-as-a-Service
   (SaaS) Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application.  The
   customer wishes to gain business insights by granting a specialized
   third-party analytics platform limited access to its CRM data.

   The CRM application obtains a delegation token from the enterprise's
   identity provider.  It then creates a narrowly scoped delegated
   access token for the analytics service.  This token only permits read
   access to a predefined, non-sensitive subset of customer data (e.g.,
   names and identifiers, but not personal email addresses).  The
   analytics platform uses this token to pull data, generates an
   aggregated business intelligence report, and delivers it back to the
